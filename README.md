# Capita---Power-Method
Power Method for Sparse Matrices

Implements the power method to compute the biggest eigenvector and the biggest eigenvalue of a sparse matrix.

The code has the following structure:

  sparse.hpp - Implements the sparse matrix class which creates its Data Structure and also some useful member functions.

  power.hpp - Implements the power method algorithms for three different variants.

  mmarket.hpp - Reads a matrix-market file and creates a sparse matrix from the information within the file.

  tools.hpp - Contains some vector manipulation functions

  main.cpp - Main file where tests are conducted.
